# Welcome to Learn Javascript

**Preface**

- This is a repository which I am documenting in my Javascript learning Journey.
- I will try documenting each and every step in the simplest way to learn this language and the possibilities
- I will also introduce Node Js and Express Js to describe the understanding on how Javascript can be useful in Server side.
- We will try making a single page application throughout this learning process and possibly come up with an interactive application which will help us learn Javascript and also HTML CSS and Server Side Operations.
- We will try covering the important topics only in order to have a consised learning experience.
- The end goal is to have a significant understanding on the language and technologies.
- In the advanced parts, we will get introduced to typescript and compare the differences.

**In order to get the best experience, follow these steps**

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- I have added readmes in all the sections in the project, feel free to navigate and explore the directories
- All the source code for each examples for Js concepts will be inside the template/src directory.
